# Presentations

Presentation length: 10 -12 mins
(Generally people speak faster when they present live. Therefore target a 13 - 14 min presentation when practicing)


You must present the project, during the presentation you will have to:

1. Introduce yourself
2. Introduce your project and its unique style
3. What you learned prior to the project and how it was applicable 
4. Introduce your project - Not the bugs or issues, just the working stuff
5. Show any wireframes/ designs
6. Show project functionality
7. Show code
    - the best presentations have LOTS of comments describing the code, specifically WHY a line of code exists 
8. Describe the code
    - generally speak to it in blocks, then when there is something interesting pull us into the details
    - Be prepared to talk about your project from a technical standpoint - i.e. how the JavaScript works, why you decided to organize your HTML the way you did, how the CSS supports your vision for the project
9. What you learned while doing the project
10. Describe desired future features
    - What would you want to add in the future
    - Talk to your bugs (especially the ones you know how to fix but just didn't have time)
    - Don't act like you're seeing new bugs live
11. Show your resources - what websites did you use for what? (You can also pull up your resources throughout your presentation if that makes sense for you)
12. Take any questions
13. Thank everyone for listening in

We will be inviting the rest of the company, as well as past and present cohorts to attend the presentation (it'll probably just be a small gathering of familiar faces, but just a heads up).

Things to remember:
-	No tabs/ windows open other than project 
-	If there is a bug / weird behavior donâ€™t bring attention to it

Questions to answer during presentation:
-	Why did you choose it do it the way you did?
-	What are you most proud of?
-	What was your biggest struggle?
-	What did you learn?
-	What are some future features you would want to add?
-	Did you collaborate throughout the project?
-	What resources did you utilize?
