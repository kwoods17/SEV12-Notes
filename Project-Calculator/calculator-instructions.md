# Instructions
Create a calculator using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Some of the guidelines are as follows:
 
- Use what we've learned in class - we've gone over everything you'll need to know to complete this project - the point is to reinforce what we've been learning in class. Use class notes, your past assignments and / or documentation to help you get a better understanding of how something works. Videos are totally fine as well, just shy away from calculator tutorial projects as this completely defeats the purpose of this exercise.
- If you want to bring anything new into the project, be prepared to give a detailed explanation of what it does and why you decided to choose that way of doing things.
- You should have separate HTML, JS & CSS files.
- DO NOT USE THE EVAL() FUNCTION. It is undesirable and insecure according to multiple sources, including MDN. It also defeats the purpose of this project. You can read about it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
- At a minimum, the calculator should be able to multiply, divide, add & subtract. Calculators have more buttons and have more complexity than this. Once you've reached the MVP of multiplying, dividing, adding & subtracting feel free to continue adding features!
- YOU MUST INCORPORATE FLEXBOX OR GRID INTO THE PROJECT (they work very well together btw). Flexbox in particular is important to know how to use as a developer today.
- Be sure to post links to your project to this Team assignment.

Good luck!
 
ALSO NOTE:
I will be scheduling time for presentations.
 
Be prepared to talk about your project from a technical standpoint - i.e. how the JavaScript works, why you decided to organize your HTML the way you did, how the CSS supports your vision for the project.
 
We will be inviting the rest of the company, as well as past and present cohorts to attend the presentation (it'll probably just be a small gathering of familiar faces, but just a heads up).
